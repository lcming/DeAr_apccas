\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this work, we propose a high throughput, power-efficient and flexible DSP design, DeAr,
which is suitable for fast-evolving wireless communication protocols.
DeAr manipulates SMT in the datapath to improve the hardware utilization, 
and its compact design reduces the cost of power and area.
It also features implicit RF access to improve the code density.
By leveraging the proposed HDFG-based scheduling, 
DeAr exhaustively forwards data for ALU, 
and has only 1.11\% (BLAS) and 4.26\% (GDSPK) loss in OPC against VLIW in spite of its hardware simplification,
With identical ALU, RF resources and the throughput requirement ranging from 50 to 1000 MOPS, DeAr improves 20.3\% to 13.1\% and 31.8\% 2.2\% of power, 36.1\% to 31.5\% and 28.2\% to 5.7\% of area, compared with VLIW and composite-ALU (an ASIP implementation) respectively.

Our future work will focus on scaling up DeAr to the many-core architecture facilitating data-intensive computation.
The scheduling approach in this work is not suitable for massive threads management, 
which is usually performed dynamically by a dedicated hardware (i.e., warp scheduler in GPU).
Applying such a thread management unit to DeAr while keeping the hardware simplicity requires more studies.
